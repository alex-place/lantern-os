/**
 * Kalshi fee + expected-value model — the grounded gate for trade suggestions.
 *
 * Σ₀ rule: a "buy" suggestion is an important claim, so it needs evidence. A binary
 * contract is only worth taking when its expected value is positive AFTER fees — win
 * rate alone is a trap (you can win 53% of the time and still lose money if the wins
 * are small and the losses are full). This module is the external-reality anchor the
 * suggestion engine checks before it presents a card.
 *
 * FEE FORMULA (Kalshi published Feb-2026 fee schedule):
 *     fee = roundup_to_cent( multiplier × C × P × (1 − P) )
 *   - P = price in dollars (0..1), C = contracts, multiplier = 0.07 for standard
 *     markets (some series 0.035; crypto/premium higher). Rounded UP to the next cent
 *     on the total order.
 *   - The per-contract fee peaks at P=0.50: 0.07 × 0.25 = 0.0175 → ~1.75¢/contract.
 *   Sources (fetched 2026-06-29):

 *
 * BREAK-EVEN: buying at price p (in prob), payout $1, the win probability needed to
 * break even is p PLUS the fee fraction — on Kalshi that pushes a 50¢ contract's
 * breakeven from 50% to ~51.75%. Source: https://marketmath.io/tools/breakeven-calculator
 *
 *     netEV_per_contract = w·(1−p) − (1−w)·p − fee = (w − p) − feeFraction(p)
 *     +EV  ⟺  w > p + feeFraction(p) = breakevenWinProb(p)
